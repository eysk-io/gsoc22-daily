# Google Summer of Code 2022 - Daily Updates
This repository contains a log of all my activities and daily updates for Google Summer of Code 2022. Specifically for the [Entity Custom Resource Definitions for GitOps](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/yd9z3DBo) project.

It will be a working `.md` file that logs all of my activities in lieu of synchronous daily stand-up scrum meetings. Each day will answer the following questions:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Are there blockers?
